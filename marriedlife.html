<h3>SEARCH FOR A WIFE</h3>
<p>
    After the incident of his father's death, the search for a woman for him to marry begun in earnest. As at was the custom then, the elders took it upon themselves to 
    find him a lady they thought would be ideal for him. A wonderful woman in the person of Miss Mulikat Ayanwale was found for him, the necessary arrangements were made 
    for them to get married and married they did get. By that time, Pa Ajani has already completed his training and has followed one of his paternal uncles to Lagos to began a new life.
    He was invited back to Aiyetoro at a point to come see the woman they found for him and to know if he liked her. He did like her, the necessary arrangements were made after their marriage
    for his new wife to come join him in Lagos as he was now living alone having worked enough to be able to rent a room for himself in the Abule Egba area of Lagos State.

    His new wife Mrs. Mulikat Ogunshola (nee Ayanwale) joined him later in Abule Egba and his married life became in earnest. The marriage was blessed with three children namely Adebayo, Taiwo (who later lost his twin sister) and Rukayat. They were born
    in that order. Things moved smoothly for him and the family not until sometimes in 1997 the marriage reached a stumbling block and crashed. The couples split and went away with the two male children following their father and the female staying with the 
    mother which in Yoruba culture is termed a final divorce with no hope of reconciliation.

<p>
    Pa Ajani remarried a single mother sometimes later in his life but that marriage didn't last long as it also reached rock bottom due to infidelity on the part of the new wife's part. He divorced her and stayed unmarried until his death.
