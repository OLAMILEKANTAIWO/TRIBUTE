        </h3>
        Pa Ogunshola Ajani Bashiru was born in Idofoi Quarters of Aiyetoro Town in Yewa North Local Government Of Ogun State in the year 1945. The exact date isnt known as record keeping
        wasn't really a thing then so most people use significant events or happenings during that year to estimate thier age. According to reports, 1945 was the year Pa Ajani was born and he maintained
        the date until his death even though the day and month isn't known but he grew like a normal kid albeit with poor parents but his parent tried everything to make his childhood as fun as possible even

        He was moved around as a kid to live with family members who treated him varyingly; some treated him nicely while others treated him no less than a slave because they in those days believe that
        the more suffering you endure, the more wiser you become but Pa Bashir endure through it all and was able to complete Primary 6 education even though he pleaded with his relatives to allow him at least
        finish secondary school but they all turn a deaf ear to him even though he showed that he was an exceptionally brilliant pupil but as the people he was made to live with in those days didn't have exceptionally
        briliant kids like him, they refuse because many of them felt that sending him to secondary school might likely give him an edge over their kids which was eventually the case.
